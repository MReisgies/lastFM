# Top Songs

I created this project to learn how to do simple AJAX API requests.
The target of my web app is to search for information about artists via the last.fm API.


## Project Documentation with MkDocs

The full documentation in German is hosted with GithubPages in a static MkDocs website: https://mreisgies.github.io/top-songs/

MkDocs is a static site generator that's geared towards building project documentation. Documentation source files are written in Markdown, and configured with a YAML configuration file.
